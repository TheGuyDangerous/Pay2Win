# Flutter Application for Expense Tracking Between Friends

## Comprehensive Prompt for AI Agent Development

### Project Overview

Create a Flutter application called "Pay2Win" that tracks monthly expenses between two friends to compare savings. The application should allow users to input their salary and track daily expenses through messaging. The goal is to create a competitive savings environment that encourages financial responsibility through friendly competition.

### Technical Architecture

*Frontend*: Flutter for cross-platform compatibility
*Backend*: Firebase for authentication, real-time database, and cloud functions
*State Management*: Provider pattern or Riverpod for state management
*Analytics*: Firebase Analytics for understanding user behavior
*Storage*: Cloud Firestore for storing user data, transactions, and messages

### Authentication & User Onboarding

1. Create a login/signup screen with email/password and social authentication options
2. Implement a user profile setup where users can:
   - Add a profile picture
   - Set a username
   - Input their monthly salary
   - Set financial goals

3. Design a duo-making channel where users can:
   - Create a new room with a unique code
   - Join an existing room using a code
   - Send invitation links through messaging apps

4. Once two users are connected, permanently lock the duo relationship until explicitly deleted
5. Implement secure authentication tokens with proper expiration and refresh mechanisms
